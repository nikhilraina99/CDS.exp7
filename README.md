2. **Reverse Array Elements**
   - Write a C++ program to reverse the order of elements in an array.

3. **Sum and Average of Array Elements**
   - Write a C++ program to compute the sum and average of elements in an array.

4. **Find Maximum and Minimum Elements**
   - Write a C++ program to find the maximum and minimum values in an array.

5. **Search for Element and Count Occurrences**
   - Write a C++ program to find the position of an element and count its occurrences in an array.

6. **Input from User**
   - Write a C++ program to take user input for various operations.

7. **String Concatenation**
   - Write a C++ program to concatenate two strings.

8. **Reverse a String**
   - Write a C++ program to reverse a string.

9. **Check for Palindrome**
   - Write a C++ program to check if a string is a palindrome.

# Theory

**Arrays:** In C++, an array is a data structure that stores multiple values of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. Arrays are useful for organizing data and performing operations on multiple elements simultaneously.

**Strings:** In C++, strings are sequences of characters. They can be represented using either the std::string class or C-style character arrays. Strings are used for storing and manipulating text data effectively.
